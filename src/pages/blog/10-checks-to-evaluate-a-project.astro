      <section class="space-y-4">
        <p>
          When Vishal and Deepika booked an apartment in a heavily promoted pre-launch near Airport Road, they walked
          out of the sales lobby feeling like winners. The sales team told them the project was
          <em>“95% sold out already”</em>, prices would increase at <em>11 AM the next day</em>, and the clubhouse
          render shown to them was <em>“the largest in North Bangalore”</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          They were told there were <em>“only 3 units left”</em>. The metro station was said to be
          <em>“confirmed and approved”</em>. The sample flat was staged like a luxury hotel suite. Everything was designed
          to trigger urgency.
        </p>

        <p class="border-l-2 border-red-400/70 pl-4 italic text-slate-100">
          Two years later, construction slowed after a land approval complication. The clubhouse was revealed to be a
          reused render from another project. The metro station turned out to be speculation repeated enough times that
          it sounded like truth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, they are paying rent <span class="font-semibold">and</span> pre-EMI for a home that still does not have a
          clear delivery timeline.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their mistake wasn’t choosing North Bangalore. Their mistake was choosing without checking the right
          fundamentals — trusting pressure more than facts.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold text-cyan-300">
          If you’re buying in 2025, your biggest risk is not choosing the wrong area — it’s rushing into a project
          without due diligence.

          Why Most Buyers Fall into Marketing Traps
        </h2>
        <p>
          Real estate purchase decisions are emotional. Builders understand that emotion is stronger than logic, and
          marketing is engineered to create urgency. Phrases like <em>“last few units”</em>, <em>“24-hour price lock”</em>,
          <em>“exclusive launch discounts”</em>, <em>“airport connectivity advantage”</em> and <em>“investor price”</em>
          are psychological triggers — not investment analysis.

          10 Critical Checks Before Booking Any Real Estate Project
        </h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-sm sm:text-base">
          <!-- Check 1 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">1. Builder Track Record & Delivery History</h3>
            <p>
              The builder matters more than marketing. Look beyond brochures. Evaluate past projects, delivery timelines,
              construction quality, complaints, litigation and post-handover maintenance reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              A great project from a weak builder is a gamble. A good project from a reliable builder is rare security.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 2 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">2. RERA Registration and Approval Clarity</h3>
            <p>
              Never depend on verbal statements. Always check the official RERA portal for approval numbers, timelines,
              phase details and land ownership documents. Many buyers don’t understand that brochures are not legal.
              RERA is.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 3 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">3. Micro-Location Reality vs Google Maps</h3>
            <p>
              Location is not a dot on a map — it’s the real feel when you stand there at 8 AM, 6 PM and 10 PM. Visit the
              site. Walk the neighbourhood. Talk to shopkeepers and residents. Reality is very different from marketing
              photography.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 4 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">4. Water Supply & Flooding History</h3>
            <p>
              Many gorgeous projects suffer permanent water shortage or flooding every monsoon. Ask residents of nearby
              completed communities real questions: <em>“Did basements flood?”</em> <em>“What is the water source in summer?”</em>
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 5 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">5. Realistic All-In Pricing (Not Just Rate per Sq Ft)</h3>
            <p>
              Builders quote a low price per sq ft to anchor the conversation. But the real cost includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Floor rise</li>
              <li>Clubhouse & infrastructure charges</li>
              <li>Car parking</li>
              <li>Legal & agreement charges</li>
              <li>Corpus fund & maintenance</li>
              <li>Registration & stamp duty</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Compare <span class="font-semibold">final all-inclusive cost</span>, not showroom pricing.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 6 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">6. Rental Demand & Resale Liquidity</h3>
            <p>
              Check real rental listings in that micro-market. If the area is full of vacant homes waiting for tenants,
              resale liquidity will also be weak. Strong rental demand is proof of real value — not speculation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 7 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">7. Internal Road Access and Traffic Flow</h3>
            <p>
              “Airport Road” is useless if the internal roads are narrow, broken or jammed at peak hours.
              <span class="font-semibold">Drive the exact route</span> you’ll use to and from work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Check 8 -->
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">8. Future Surrounding Land Use</h3>
            <p>
              Land around your project determines long-term experience. Is it residential? Green zone? Industrial?
              Commercial? Empty land next to your building could turn into a petrol pump, wedding hall, bar or truck depot.
              Always check master plan documents.

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-cyan-300 text-lg">9. Usability of Amenities (Not Just Quantity)</h3>
            <p>
              50 amenities on paper does not mean quality. What matters is daylight, ventilation, clubhouse placement,
              pedestrian pathways, lift capacity, parking flow and upkeep capability.

            <p>
              Forget what Instagram says about real estate. Ask yourself:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Will my family be happy living here daily?</li>
              <li>Can I comfortably handle EMIs even if income changes?</li>
              <li>Would I still buy this project if appreciation takes longer?</li>

            <p>
              For most buyers, 2–4 weeks of structured research is enough. If you feel pressured to decide in 24 hours,
              that’s a sign to walk away — not commit.

            <p>
              Sample flats are marketing theatre — not reality. Check actual floor plans, bare structure layouts and
              confirmed apartment dimensions to avoid disappointment later.

            <p>
              Visit the state RERA website and search using the project’s registration number. Check approvals, timelines,
              land title details and builder commitments legally documented.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-slate-50">4. Is pre-launch pricing actually a discount?</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes yes, but often it’s psychological anchoring. Many pre-launches priced “lower” eventually match or
              exceed completed project costs due to delays or overruns. Compare real data, not excitement.

            <p>
              Both matter, but builder reliability is your safety belt. A great builder can create value even in a
              developing location. A weak builder can destroy value even in an amazing location.

            <p>
              Real value lies in usability and maintenance. 5 meaningful amenities are better than 50 unusable ones.

            <p>
              Under-construction can be cheaper initially but carries time risk. Ready homes offer certainty but cost
              more. The right choice depends on finances and urgency.

            <p>
              Future infra can create amazing returns — but only when the core project fundamentals are strong. Never buy
              <em>only</em> because someone says “metro coming soon”.

            <p>
              Never make a booking on the first visit. Walk out, think, and return with clarity. If a builder can’t hold
              a unit for 24 hours, there is something wrong.

            <p>
              Yes. Losing ₹50,000 is better than losing 50 lakhs if fundamentals are weak. Courage > ego.

              If the answer is yes — book. If no — walk away.

          Final Word: Slow Decisions Save Lives
        </h2>

        <p>
          The real estate industry rewards speed and pressure. But your family deserves clarity and peace — not panic and
          regret. The right project is never sold through fear. It is chosen through understanding.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold text-cyan-300">
          If you need help evaluating a project, comparing options or simply understanding whether a property fits your
          life, we’re here to guide without pressure.

      {/* STORY INTRO */}
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <p>
          On a cloudy Saturday morning, three families walked into the Poulomi Florique site office for the first time.
          All of them had one thing in common – they were tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tired of seeing cramped living rooms marketed as “spacious 3 BHKs”. Tired of dusty approach roads leading to
          projects advertised as “prime location”. Tired of boiler-room sales calls pushing them to “book in the next
          one hour”.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many serious buyers in North Bangalore, the search isn’t just about <em>finding a flat</em>. It’s about
          finding a home that balances:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>reasonable access to tech corridors,</li>
          <li>a calm, livable community, and</li>
          <li>a developer who takes design and detailing seriously.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Poulomi Florique positions itself right at this intersection – a 9-acre, nature-forward, Bloomscapes®-themed
          community off Thanisandra Main Road, near Bhartiya City. This review is an attempt to see if it truly lives
          up to that positioning.
        </p>

      {/* WHAT IS FLORIQUE */}
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">
          What Exactly Is Poulomi Florique?
        </h2>
        <p>
          At its core, Florique is a mid-to-upper-premium apartment community focused primarily on 3 BHK homes, with a
          few 2.5 BHK options. The project combines:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>A sizeable land parcel with generous open spaces,</li>
          <li>A strong landscape and Bloomscapes® theme, and</li>
          <li>A clubhouse + amenity mix aimed at families who plan to live in the project full-time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Instead of chasing extreme density, the design leans more towards breathing spaces, courts, gardens and
          visual openness between towers. That alone sets it apart from several hyper-packed projects in fast-growing
          corridors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven’t seen the visual overview yet, it’s worth visiting the dedicated project page:

      {/* LOCATION SECTION */}
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">
          Location & Micro-Market: Thanisandra – Bhartiya City Belt
        </h2>
        <p>
          Florique sits in the North Bangalore belt, in proximity to Thanisandra Main Road and the Bhartiya City
          ecosystem. This is important to understand: you are not buying in an isolated pocket; you are plugging into a
          larger urban story that already has IT parks, schools, malls and social infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many potential buyers, the big questions are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>How practical will my daily office commute be?</li>
          <li>What will my children’s school runs look like?</li>
          <li>Will this feel liveable after the “new project excitement” fades?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That is where this belt has an advantage over more speculative, far-out locations. When compared to very
          early-stage airport-side layouts, this corridor is already live, with a mix of:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>IT and business ecosystems,</li>
          <li>Retail and daily convenience options,</li>
          <li>Institutional and educational presence, and</li>
          <li>Relatively shorter commute bands to Manyata and other hubs (subject to traffic).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s still North Bangalore, so you’re not “central city” close. But for many buyers working in northern or
          north-eastern tech belts, the trade-off is acceptable.
        </p>

      {/* DESIGN & LIFESTYLE */}

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">
          Design Language & Everyday Lifestyle
        </h2>
        <p>
          Where Florique tries to differentiate itself is in its landscape and planning language. The Bloomscapes® idea
          is not just a marketing tagline – it’s a commitment to floral, green and theme-based outdoor spaces that
          shape how residents experience the campus daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadly, the project leans on:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Themed gardens (butterfly, fragrant, herb, reflexology style areas),</li>
          <li>Vehicle-free podium experiences,</li>
          <li>Multiple courts and sports facilities,</li>
          <li>A significant clubhouse volume, and</li>
          <li>Carefully positioned leisure lawns, pools and community courts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For families who really use common areas – kids playing outdoors, adults walking in the evenings, seniors
          needing calm sit-out zones – this kind of planning matters more than a long amenity list on a brochure.

              </li>
              <li>
                Check tower placement, floor-to-floor distances and sunlight penetration for your specific unit stack.
              </li>
              <li>
                As with any large project, check RERA details, phasing and realistic possession timelines.
              </li>
              <li>
                Understand maintenance expectations – a richer landscape and amenity mix requires proper upkeep.

          No project is perfect for everyone. The goal is to understand whether Florique’s strengths match your family’s

              1. Is Poulomi Florique mainly for end-users or investors?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It is positioned more as an end-user-friendly, lifestyle community with strong open spaces, a large
              clubhouse and a 3 BHK-led profile. Investors may still consider it, but the core design language and
              amenity focus clearly lean towards families who plan to live there.

              2. How does the location compare to other parts of North Bangalore?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Thanisandra – Bhartiya belt offers a balance of township ecosystem, access to tech corridors and
              partial separation from heavy traffic chaos of certain junctions. It isn’t “central city” close, but for
              many northern/IT professionals, it strikes a workable middle ground between commute and liveability.

              3. What kind of buyer profile is Florique likely to attract?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Expect a mix of mid to senior professionals, IT/tech families, some NRIs and end-users upgrading from
              smaller 2/2.5 BHKs into more generous 3 BHK homes. The open space emphasis and amenity mix usually appeal
              to people who treat this as a long-term home rather than a stopover.

              4. Is this a right choice if I work at Manyata Tech Park?

            <p>
              It can be, provided you are comfortable with the commute band during peak hours. Many buyers working at
              Manyata explore this belt precisely because it offers a different lifestyle than living right next to the
              tech park, while still staying within a reasonable drive radius in most scenarios.

            <p>
              Shortlist 2–3 serious alternatives within similar ticket ranges and ask: Which one gives me the best mix
              of liveability, trust in developer, clarity of plans, unit layout comfort and realistic timelines? Avoid
              comparisons based only on brochure amenity counts or rate per sq ft.

              6. Does the Bloomscapes® concept actually matter beyond aesthetics?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It matters if you value daily experience. The focus on floral and theme-based landscapes, along with

              7. Should I worry about long-term maintenance of such a landscape-rich project?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Any project with richer landscape, water bodies and amenity density requires disciplined maintenance. It’s
              important to understand estimated maintenance charges, association planning and how the developer typically
              manages communities post-handover in other projects, if available for reference.

            </h3>
            <p>
              It can be, especially if you are currently in a congested layout or older building with limited amenities.
              Florique’s positioning works well for families moving into a more future-ready community with better open
              spaces and amenity planning, provided the pricing aligns with your financial comfort zone.

              9. What should I look for specifically when choosing a unit here?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Focus on tower orientation, floor level, stack position (corner vs internal), balcony views, privacy from
              neighbouring towers, noise exposure, and distance to lifts and common areas. A well-chosen stack can
              dramatically improve how the apartment feels, even within the same project.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The presence of walking paths, sit-outs, calmer landscaped zones and a largely podium-style layout can be
              a plus for seniors. But it’s still important to evaluate lift reliability, emergency medical access,
              proximity to hospitals and tower-level accessibility for them specifically.

              11. How should I think about appreciation and rental potential?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Florique sits in a belt that already has demand drivers from IT, township ecosystems and airport-side
              growth. Well-chosen units in liveable communities often see more stable long-term traction in both rentals
              and resale. That said, appreciation is never guaranteed – it depends on overall market cycles, entry price
              and holding period.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Timelines depend on the specific phase, construction progress and regulatory milestones. Always verify
              possession estimates directly through official documentation and on-ground status, rather than relying
              only on verbal estimates or generic dates.

              13. How does this compare with smaller, standalone projects in the area?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Standalone projects may offer lower density or a quieter feel, but often lack the scale of amenities and
              landscape that a larger community like Florique offers. If you prioritise comprehensive on-campus
              facilities, Florique may stand out; if you value hyper-low density above all else, you may want to compare
              with smaller alternatives.

            </h3>
            <p>
              A horizon of 7–10 years is often more realistic for extracting both lifestyle value and meaningful
              long-term gains from such communities. If you are unsure about staying committed for at least that long,
              it’s better to reconsider your timing or expectations.

          Final Take: Should Poulomi Florique Be on Your Shortlist?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
          If you are looking for a long-term home in North Bangalore with strong emphasis on open spaces, curated
          amenities and a largely 3 BHK-driven profile, Poulomi Florique deserves a serious, honest look. It is not a
          magic answer to every buyer’s situation, but for the right profile, it sits in a very relevant sweet spot
          between lifestyle and long-term sense.

          The best next step is not to believe or reject this review blindly – it’s to visit, walk the site, test your
          commute, ask hard questions and compare it with 2–3 other genuine contenders. That is where platforms like
          Brick.com come in: to help you make that comparison without confusion or pressure.
